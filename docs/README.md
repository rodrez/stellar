# Stellar Terminal Emulator

## Overview

Stellar is a modular terminal emulator written in Python, designed to be extensible and support multiple windowing systems. The project is structured to allow for easy replacement or addition of components like window engines and rendering engines.

## Features

- Cross-platform windowing support with multiple backends (starting with Tkinter).
- Modular architecture to allow for easy swapping of components.
- Basic rendering and input handling capabilities.
- Extensible with future plans for more sophisticated rendering and window management.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `main.py` file to start the Stellar terminal emulator.

```bash
python stellar/main.py
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please read the docs/architecture.md for more details on the project structure and how to add new components.

Now, Stellar is ready to move forward with a modular architecture. Let me know if you'd like to add more features or proceed with additional implementations!
